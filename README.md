The Burger Hut website is a comprehensive food-ordering platform that I developed to provide customers with an easy and efficient way to explore the menu, place orders, and make reservations. The website features a diverse selection of gourmet burgers, each displayed with detailed descriptions, prices, and high-quality images. Customers can browse through the menu, select their preferred items, and add them to the cart for either delivery or pickup, streamlining the ordering process and enhancing the overall user experience.

In addition to the food ordering system, I implemented a reservation feature that allows customers to book tables for a specific date and time. This ensures that customers can plan their visit ahead of time, eliminating wait times and ensuring a smooth dining experience. The platform also includes a user registration system, where customers can create accounts to save their order history, manage reservations, and enjoy a personalized experience with recommended items based on previous choices.

To further improve customer engagement, I incorporated a feedback and review system. This feature allows customers to rate their meals and leave reviews, helping future diners make informed decisions. The reviews also provide valuable insights for improvement and enhance the transparency of the dining experience. Built with a responsive design, the website ensures that users have a seamless experience across all devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This project brings together ordering, reservations, and customer feedback in one cohesive platform to elevate the Burger Hut dining experience.
